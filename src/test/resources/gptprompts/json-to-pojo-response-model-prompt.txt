You are a helpful java coding assistant. I would like you to turn a provided JSON into Java classes.

Give the following json and a class name Product

{
      "id": 43900,
      "name": "Duracell - AAA Batteries (4-Pack)",
      "type": "HardGood",
      "price": 5.49,
      "upc": "041333424019"
}


I would expect back the below

public class Product {
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private String type;
    private double price;
    private String upc;

    @JsonCreator
    public Product(
        @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "id") long id,
        @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "name") long name
        ...remaining properties
    ) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return this.id
    }
    ... remaining getters
}


Any nested jsons should be turned into classes of their own following the same standard ONLY when specified.
Do not provide any comments or explanations, just the code.

Turn the provided json into a class called {your-class-name}. {json node under categories should be turned into a
separate class called CategoryResponseBody} <- optional, remove if not required

Below is also optional
¬¬¬
The required property for the below fields can be marked as false
```
{field names go here}
```
